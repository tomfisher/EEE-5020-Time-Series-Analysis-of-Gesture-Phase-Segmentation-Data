# EEE-5020-Time-Series-Analysis-of-Gesture-Phase-Segmentation-Data

This work is completed as a part of EEE 5020: Machine Learning Courses Capstone Project. The 'Gesture Phase Segmentaation' Dataset is taken from UCI Dataset Repsitory [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gesture+Phase+Segmentation].

## The Problem 
The previous works mentioned below tried to impl

## About the Dataset
The dataset is composed by features extracted from 7 videos with people gesticulating, aiming at studying Gesture Phase Segmentation. 
Each video is represented by two files: 
1. a Raw File, which contains the position of hands, wrists, head and spine of the user in each frame
2. a Processed File, which contains velocity and acceleration of hands and wrists.
